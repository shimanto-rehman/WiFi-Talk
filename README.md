# Wifi Talks App

ðŸ’¬ Chat on your Local Area Network with this Flutter application.

## Structure 
This repository contains 2 main projects:
1. A NodeJS project that is located under the `websocket-server` folder.
2. Flutter project that is in fact all these folders except for the `websocket-server` folder.  

## Getting Started

It is really easy to get started:
1. Run the WebSocket -> [Guide]()
2. Build the flutter project -> `flutter build apk --release` and `flutter install`

## Why
This project is mainly created to show of the power of a WebSocket. I also made a Flutter application to show some best practices, like using the `provider`, `web_socket_channel` and `uuid` packages.
